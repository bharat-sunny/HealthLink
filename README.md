During Covid 19 Pandemic, hospitals and doctors encountered the most challenging experiences and inevitable issues like anticipation of number of patients, lack of resources, efficient tracking and accessibility to medical provisions. In order to restrain from repeating the same mistake, be it Covid 19 or any other medical issue, the provision of medical services should be the top priority.

Thus, this project aimed to produce a robust real-time application that helps to bring patients, doctors, insurance agents and pharmacists together under one umbrella. As our final academic project of the Fall2021 semester, we designed and developed an ecosystem which follows its operations inter-cities as well as inter-state. This application can be easily scaled up globally.Our ecosystem consists of a network with 4 major Enterprises, 11 Organizations and 13 roles to carry out their respective functionality. The network can be identified with the help of Zip codes. Apart from this, we also added advanced functionalities like Google map accessibility, Live web-cam image capture, printing of invoices and prescriptions as unique selling points of our project.
